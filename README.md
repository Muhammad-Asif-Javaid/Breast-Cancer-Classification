## 🧠 Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to classify breast tumors as **malignant** or **benign** using tabular clinical features.

The model is trained using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** and evaluated on the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset**, a widely used benchmark dataset for binary classification tasks.

### 🔹 Key Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature standardization using StandardScaler
- Train-test data splitting
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model
- Model training and validation
- Performance evaluation

### 🔹 Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib

### 🔹 Dataset
- Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (Tabular / CSV)
- Benchmark dataset commonly used for machine learning research and experimentation

### 🔹 Objective
The primary goal of this project is **learning and demonstrating machine learning concepts**, including preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.  
This project is intended for **educational purposes** and not for clinical deployment.

### 🔹 Results
The trained model achieves high accuracy on the test dataset, demonstrating effective classification performance on benchmark data.

### 🔹 Future Improvements
- Compare ANN with traditional ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest)
- Add confusion matrix and ROC-AUC analysis
- Perform cross-validation
- Test on additional real-world datasets
